# Discord-Bot
A basic Discord bot built using the Discord.js library. It includes a simple slash command (/ping) that responds with "Pong!" and a message listener that replies "Hi from Bot" or generates a response based on the create command. The bot also listens for interactions and replies accordingly. It uses the Discord REST API to refresh commands .
